A bank is introducing a new range of Automated Teller
Machines (ATMs) across all its branches. These ATMs
will be distributed at local branches, and be linked to head
office’s mainframe which stores details of all customer
accounts. The ATMs will allow customers to access
details of their account, such as the balance, and
withdraw cash provided they have sufficient funds
remaining. Customers can also request an overdraft via
an ATM and receive an instant decision (less than 10
seconds). Customers will use the ATM by inserting their
account card and entering a 4-digit PIN. Customers
should be able to change this PIN via the ATM as well.
The branch manager for a customer should also be able
to use a branch terminal to access the mainframe for
information on that customer’s account and to approve an
overdraft for them if they visit the branch with proof of
identification.
